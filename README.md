# Georgia Opioid Epidemic Project
After learning that the state of Georgia was in an opioid crisis, we sought to find out what socioeconomic factors influenced the opioid prescriptions rates. To do so, we collected and cleaned data from several CSV files from a various sources and web scraped data from the HTML of websites. The data we used can also be found in this repository. 

With the data, we...
* created 5 insights
* generated 3 data visualizations
* exported the aggregated data to 2 summary files
* designed a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to compare various different variables on a graph

Our explanation of our code, insights, and data visualizations can be found in the files named PhaseII.ipynb and PhaseII.py. To learn more about the project, watch our presentation [here](https://youtu.be/DAeVMCb9bxQ).

## Insight Questions:
* What is the relationship between the opioid prescription rates and the educational attainment in Georgia (less than 9th grade, high school graduate, bachelorâ€™s degree percentage)?
* What is the relationship between the opioid prescription rates and the unemployment, employed, and not in labor force percentage in Georgia?
* What is the maximum, minimum, and average rate opioid prescription rate (# of Prescriptions Per Person) out of all the counties of Georgia?
* What is the relationship between opioid prescription rates and economic variables such as unemployment insurance, income maintenance benefits, and supplements to salaries?
* What is the relationship between opioid prescription rates and income?
